# About
This C program implements the full abstract data structure of a deque for either integer or float values. Several deques at the same time are allowed. Currently the program's interface is in English, however, work is being done to translate it into English.

Implemented functions:
1. Creation of a deque
2. Printing of a deque's values
3. Insertion of a value to the front of deque
4. Insertion of a value to the back of deque
5. Deletion of a value from the front of deque
6. Deletion of a value from the back of deque
7. Checking if deque is empty
8. Checking if deque is full
9. Removal of deque
10. End program

# Usage
* Open "deque.h" in a text editor, change the keyword "int" in "typedef int dataType" to either "float" for floating values or leave it as "int" for integers and save the file. 
* Open terminal in the downloaded folder, enter "make", which creates an executable "main.exe". 
* Launch the executable by entering ".\main". After launching, the program interface guides the user further by explaining the functions.
